# Basic-Python-Math-Tasks
Python exercises for practicing basic math concepts such as area and circumference of a circle, pizza cost calculation, slope and distance between points, and more.

## Functions Included

- `areaOfCircle()`: Calculates and prints the area of a circle given its radius.
- `circumferenceOfCircle()`: Calculates and prints the circumference of a circle given its radius.
- `costOfPizza()`: Calculates the price of a pizza based on its diameter.
- `slopeOfLine()`: Computes the slope of a line given two points.
- `distanceBetweenPoints()`: Calculates the distance between two points in 2D space.
- `travelStatistics()`: Computes distance traveled and an associated amount based on speed and duration.
- `sumOfSquares()`: Calculates 14 times the sum of squares of numbers from 1 up to a user input.
- `averageOfNumbers()`: Calculates the average of a series of numbers input by the user.

## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Pyzo, IDLE, or command line).
2. When prompted, call the function you want to test by typing its name followed by parentheses, e.g.,  
   ```python
   areaOfCircle()
